We also used a pug template engine to generate all HTML files which one is very helpful for easy customization.</p>

        </p>
        <p class='mb-0'><b>Updating from version 2 to version 3:</b><br />
        As the latest versions of templates and all their packages have different structures behind their components, you have to update all the components manually into your project.<br>
        So, it would be better to start building applications with the Bootstrap 5 version of Falcon from scratch. You can include any components from Bootstrap 5 version to your project. Bring the component and its required SCSS and place it into your current project.

        <p>You will also get the example of navbar top layout page in public/demo/navbar-top.html. Also check the following link for top nav: <a href='https://prium.github.io/falcon/${version}/demo/navbar-top.html'>https://prium.github.io/falcon/${version}/demo/navbar-top.html</a>.</p>
        <p class='mb-0'>In the same way, you can implement the Combo nav layout. Here is the documentation of combo nav layout: <a href="https://prium.github.io/falcon/${version}/modules/components/navs-and-tabs/combo-navbar.html"> https://prium.github.io/falcon/${version}/modules/components/navs-and-tabs/combo-navbar.html</a>. </p>

        <p class='mb-0'>Why did we keep it different? Because in the demo, we included HTML codes for all the Navs on every page. But most of our users need to use only one nav and do not want their users to give the option to change the nav. Thatâ€™s why we redirected the settings to the corresponding documentation page to see how they can configure it</P>`,
