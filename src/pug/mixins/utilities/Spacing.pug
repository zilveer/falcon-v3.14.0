mixin SpacingDocHeaderDescription
  p&attributes(attributes) Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from 
    code xs 
    |  to 
    code xxl
    | , have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from 
    code min-width: 0
    |  and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.

  p When using 
    code display: grid
    | , you can make use of 
    code gap 
    | utilities on the parent grid container. This can save on having to add margin utilities to individual grid items (children of a display: grid container). Gap utilities are responsive by default, and are generated via our utilities API, based on the 
    code $spacers 
    | Sass map.
